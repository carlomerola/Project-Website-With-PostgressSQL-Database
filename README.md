# Project-Website-With-PostgressSQL-Database
Website built using HTML, CSS, PHP, PostgressSQL and Bootstrap Library.
The static part of the website can be found at www.alessandracota.it

[Link to the database pdf explanation (in italian).](https://github.com/carlomerola/Project-Website-With-PostgressSQL-Database/blob/main/Merola-Progetto_Basi_Dati_pdf.pdf)  The queries are examples and are not related with the website.

I want to thank Gaia Scarpini for having introduced me to the Bootsrap library and for helping me with the logo and design.
